          Have you ever looked back at a moment or event in your life and realized
          that it was an impactful turning point? I just recently had that
          experience.

        <p class="col-12 p-content">
          A couple of months ago, a change to my main role at Buffer prompted me
          to re-evaluate how I organize myself and plan my day. The results?
          They’ve been impactful.
        </p>
  
        <p class="col-12 p-content">
          I’d love to share a bit of context.
        </p>
  
        <p class="col-12 p-content">
          I’m a Customer Advocate working in the support team at Buffer. For the
          most part, my approach to work has always been quite passive. I was able
          to succeed in my role by consuming information and reacting to questions
          brought to me. I didn’t push a lot of information outward.
        </p>
  
        <p class="col-12 p-content">
          Most of my time is spent working directly with our customers or
          contributing to projects that would impact the customer experience. Most
          of my meetings (we call them ‘syncs’) were with other members of the
          Customer Advocacy team.
        </p>
  
        <p class="col-12 p-content">
          Then, in January 2022, I had the exciting opportunity to jump into a new
          function as a liaison between the Customer Advocacy team and our
          Engineering, Product, and Design (EPD) teams. Some of my
          responsibilities would include making sure our support team is fully
          informed about what features we’re building, passing along customer
          feedback and insights to EPD, and helping to plan new feature launches.
        </p>
  
        <p class="col-12 p-content">
          I was all-in, but I also had a lot to learn about how EPD works, how
          marketing launches flow, and more. Things move fast, and the relevant
          information that I need to be effective in this role can pop up in any
          one of a number of our communications apps. There’s no way I could do
          all this without being much more organized than I was before.
        </p>
  
        <p class="col-12 p-content">
          I had no choice but to shake up how I work. I could no longer function
          in the uncertainty or anxiety that I might have forgotten something
          important that I was supposed to do. And, while I do love the fresh
          start that a new notebook and pen provides, this effort required more of
          me than just a new stationery purchase.
        </p>
  
        <p class="col-12 p-content">
          Over the last several months, I found that a combination of six mindset
          tweaks and new habits have helped me keep up with my commitments and
          reduce uncertainty.
        </p>
  
        <p class="col-12 p-content">
          *Disclaimer: While all of these habits have worked nicely for me, it
          could be the case that you’ll want to tweak them or completely ignore
          them based on your own preferences and work style.
